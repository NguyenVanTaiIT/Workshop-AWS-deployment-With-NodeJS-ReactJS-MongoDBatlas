## üöÄ What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

**Elastic Beanstalk** is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from AWS that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale applications. It supports several languages and platforms including **Node.js**, **Java**, **Python**, and **.NET**.

With Elastic Beanstalk, you focus on your **code**, and AWS handles the **infrastructure**‚Äîlike provisioning EC2 instances, load balancers, auto scaling, monitoring, and deployments.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits

- **Zero infrastructure management** ‚Äî no need to manually provision EC2, security groups, or scaling groups
- **Built-in monitoring** via **CloudWatch** and health dashboards
- **Easy deployments** via zip file or Git
- **Integrated with IAM, X-Ray, S3**, and other AWS services
- **Support for environment variables** and secret injection

---

## üéØ In this step, you will:

- Upload your **Node.js backend** as a zipped archive
- Create an **Elastic Beanstalk environment**
- Attach an **IAM role** to allow access to:
  - AWS X-Ray
  - Secrets Manager
  - S3 Buckets
- Enable the **X-Ray daemon** using `.ebextensions`
- Set up **environment variables** like `JWT_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and `PORT`

Once completed, your backend application will be fully deployed in a production-grade, autoscaled, and observable AWS environment.
