In this step, you'll create a **new Amazon S3 bucket** to store and serve product images for your e-commerce application.

The backend is already preconfigured to upload to a bucket named: `ecommerce-products-2025`


Make sure you create a bucket with **this exact name** (or update the backend code accordingly).

## üìõ Step 3: Add Bucket Policy (Optional for Public Read)

If you'd like your product images to be publicly viewable (without signed URLs), add the following **Bucket Policy**:

1. Go to your newly created bucket  
2. Choose the **Permissions** tab  
3. Click **Edit** under **Bucket Policy**, and paste the following:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUserS3Access",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:user/<your-username>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ecommerce-products-2025/*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ecommerce-products-2025/*"
    }
  ]
}

```
