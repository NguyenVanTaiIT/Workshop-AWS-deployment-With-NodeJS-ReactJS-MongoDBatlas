This workshop introduces end-to-end tracing and monitoring of a Node.js + React e-commerce application using AWS services such as X-Ray, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, and Elastic Beanstalk. You will learn how to trace user requests across services, visualize latency bottlenecks, debug backend logic, and securely manage application secrets—all within AWS.

We will use **MongoDB Atlas** for database storage, **Amazon S3** for image uploads, and **Elastic Beanstalk** for deployment. The frontend (React Vite) and backend (Node.js with Express) are integrated with **AWS X-Ray SDK**, providing deep visibility into your application’s performance and service interactions.

### Key benefits you'll gain from this workshop:
- Understand how AWS X-Ray traces requests across your backend APIs and database operations.
- Learn how to manage environment secrets securely using AWS Secrets Manager.
- Automate deployment using Elastic Beanstalk and monitor health metrics via CloudWatch.
- Visualize traces and debug issues quickly using AWS Application Signals.
- Replace traditional manual logging with structured, distributed tracing.
- Explore practical examples: product listing, uploading images, placing orders, and seeing their traces in real time.

By the end of the workshop, you will have built and deployed a full-stack e-commerce app with tracing and monitoring best practices—ready to scale and production-ready.
